# About

I had a few objectives:

 * Be able to run a 7-segment display (see `basic_countdown.py` and `seven_segment.py`)
 * Be able to run an 4-digit display using a TM1637 chip.  I couldn't do this on my own and relied on `tm1637.py` by [timwaizenegger](https://github.com/timwaizenegger/raspberrypi-examples/tree/master/actor-led-7segment-4numbers).
